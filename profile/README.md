The BrainGlobe Initiative exists to facilitate the development of interoperable
Python-based tools for computational neuroanatomy.

We have three aims:

- Develop specialist software for specific analysis and visualisation needs,
  such as [cellfinder](https://github.com/brainglobe/cellfinder) and
  [brainrender](https://github.com/brainglobe/brainrender).

- Develop core tools to facilitate others to build interoperable tools in Python, e.g. the
  [BrainGlobe Atlas API](https://github.com/brainglobe/bg-atlasapi).

- Build a community of neuroscientists and developers to share knowledge, build software and engage
  with the scientific, and open-source community (e.g. by organising hackathons).

For more details please see [the website](https://brainglobe.info). For help using the tools please contact us via the [image.sc forum](https://forum.image.sc/tag/brainglobe) and to get in touch with us about contributing, please use the [BrainGlobe Zulip chat](https://brainglobe.zulipchat.com/).

Development is currently lead by the [Neuroinformatics Unit](https://github.com/neuroinformatics-unit) at the [Sainsbury Wellcome Centre](https://www.sainsburywellcome.org/web/) and the [Gatsby Computational Neuroscience Unit](https://www.ucl.ac.uk/gatsby/gatsby-computational-neuroscience-unit).
